          <h4>VISION</h4>
          <p>
            A group of people who are joyfully together and weâ€™re together with
            God because of His kindness and commitment to humanity. Together as
            a family learning to embody this kindness and commitment one to
            another and beyond into the wider world. All this is only possible
            because of Jesus, the One who brings us together in life and keeps
            us together joyfully.
